    <H1>CHITTORGARH</H1>
    <h2> It is one of the most beautiful and underrated places in Rajasthan that falls on the way to Udaipur from Ajmer.
         The place boasts of an enchanting history and a complete view of the city below.
          It has one of the few historical towers in India that is still open to the public and one must take this rare opportunity simply for Victory Towerâ€™s beauty.
           The architectural design is very different from the inside, almost like a maze and the view from the top is simply breathtaking! To make things more interesting, this place also manufactures saris from the plants of bananas, custard apples and other such plants! </h2>
