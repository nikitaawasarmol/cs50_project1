    <H1>AULI</H1>
   <h2> This place in the Himalayas is a lesser known ski destination than Shimla, Manali or Gulmarg. 
        The lofty slopes surrounded by oak forests provide enough thrill to a professional skier as well as a novice.
         Camping is undoubtedly the best way to enjoy Auli with your buddies in the midst of snow over a bonfire and some beer.
          It also has the world’s highest man-made lake as well as Asia’s longest cable car. A little less commercialized than other hill stations, Auli is purely an adventure spot for trekking and skiing enthusiasts.</h2>
